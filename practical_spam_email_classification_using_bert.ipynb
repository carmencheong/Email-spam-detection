        "BERT stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. BERT is a model which is quite bidirectional. Bidirectional means BERT learns information from both the left and right sides of a token’s context. A model’s bidirectionality is essential for completely understanding the meaning of a language.\n",
        "\n",
        "BERT has been pre-trained on a vast corpus of unlabeled text, including the entire Wikipedia, which is 2,500 million words long, and various Book Corpus, which is over 800 million words long. Half of BERT’s success can be attributed to this pre-training phase.\n",

        "**Working of BERT**\n",
        "\n",
        "To learn the contextual relationships between words in a text, BERT utilizes Transformer, an attention mechanism. The transformer’s vanilla implementation has two mechanisms: an encoder that receives text input and a decoder that predicts the task. Only the encoder mechanism is required because the purpose of BERT is to construct a language model.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Transformer encoder reads the entire sequence of words at once, unlike directional versions that read the text input sequentially. It is classed as bidirectional as a result of this, while the actual term is non-directional. This feature allows the model to learn a word’s context based on its surroundings.\n",

( f - pcr ) technology uses live animal blood to detect the presence of infectious diseases and for the development of vaccines for such blood born diseases . it also allows for the efficient , effective , and continuous testing , management and treatment of animal populations . these facts distinguish the technology from any alternative testing and management methodology available to agriculture today - - all of which require the destruction of individual animals and even entire herds . our testing and data analysis processes also allow us not only to separate infected from clean animals , but also to gain knowledge vital to development of preventative vaccines .  to date , genethera has successfully developed the assay ability to detect mad cow and chronic wasting disease , a disease affecting elk and deer in north america . diagnostic assays for e . coli ol 57 : h 7 and johnne \\' s disease are in the final stages of development . vaccines for e . coli ol 57 : h 7 and johnne \\' s disease , both of which are diseases affecting cattle , are in advanced stages of development . in the future , the company plans to expand assay application research to a wide range of diseases / animals , the immediate targets being mad cow , hoof mouth , west nile and newcastle .  genethera can detect bse using the companies patented live animal blood test that evaluates the e . d . r . f . gene sequence . the e . d . r . f . gene is proven to decrease dramatically before any tse infection is noticeable in a live animal or human . the patent gtha holds is broad based and can detect all tse diseases including mad cow ( bse ) in cattle , cwd in elk deer and creutzfeld - jacobs in humans  the company \\' s patented test can detect these diseases faster than any other method developed in the marketplace and at far less a cost . the test can also be used on a mass scale using roche f - pcr , dna analyzing robotics equipment . genethera can analyze over 2000 blood samples a day with one f - pcr machine and a single technician . the project will prove highly profitable at approx $ 4 . 00 per test when wide scale commercialization is under way .  a multi - billion dollar , international demand for commercial mad cow testing has emerged around the globe .  japan conducted 3 million post - mortem rapid mad cow tests last year alone . they used the western blot developed by prionics ag in swizterland and bio - rad \\' s rapid test . costs are between $ 20 and $ 40 dollars per test . most importantly , other tests in the marketplace cannot detect the disease until the animal has been killed . testing through post - mortem brain tissue exams is extremely labor intensive and costly .  japan spent between $ 60 million - $ 120 million on 3 million post mortem rapid mad cow tests in 2004 .  genethera \\' s simple blood test can be collected using their patented field collection system . the sample is then mailed to the lab for testing . the company also stated in their recent 10 k that they are currently in negotiations with strategic testing partners that we believe will absorb the costs of commercializing our live animal mad cow test .  management :  dr . tony milici -
